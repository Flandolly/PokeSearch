# PokeSearch

## Description
PokeSearch is a wiki-style Pokemon search tool whose primary purpose is to be an all-in-one lookup app for all things Pokemon related without having to rely on aggregating information across different websites and other sources. This process can take an extensive amount of time, and can lead to an assortment of problems such as certain sites not being up to date, or there being inaccuracies or discrepancies reported across different sources. Motivated to tackle this issue, this app was created so that all relevant information can be accurately sourced and future-proofed from a single location.

## Contribution Guidelines

Currently, PokeSearch is only available in English and the search functionality only accepts English queries. However, I understand that Pokemon have equivalent names in other languages around the world. Consider contributing by adding support for inputting and displaying in other languages!

Also, PokeSearch is currently not exhausted and can be expanded to include even more information, such as held items, displaying other/previous in-game sprites and showing alternate forms!
